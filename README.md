# Flood_Monitoring
This is an ongoing project which is about monitoring a certain area in Greece which gets flooded frequently, using different remote sensing sensors and methods.

<h5>If someone is interested to contribute please send me an email.</h5>

More specifically, I would like to use two different type of data. One dataset formed from an optical sensor and one from a SAR sensor. Ideally, the optical images would be downloaded from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite VIIRS while Synthetic aperture radar images from Sentinel-1 program.

## About the Sensors 

### VIIRS 
The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a sensor designed and manufactured by the Raytheon Company on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA-20 weather satellites.[1] VIIRS is one of five key instruments onboard Suomi NPP, launched on October 28, 2011.[2] VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer[3] that collects imagery and radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere, and oceans in the visible and infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.[4]

I am planning to download VIIRS imagery channels from NOAA-CLASS website. The way I download and preprocess the VIIRS data is described in my blog: https://geospatialessays.wordpress.com/

### Sentinel -1
